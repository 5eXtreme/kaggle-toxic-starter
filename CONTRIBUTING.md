# Contributing to the kaggle-toxic-starter

We are open to your code contributions. You can submit pull request with two kinds of code:
1. bug fixes, which will be merged after code review and (usually) some discussion
2. new steps in the pipeline, for example:
    * pre- and post-processing steps
    * ensembling methods
    * neural networks
    * other algorithms relevant to the [challenge](https://www.kaggle.com/c/jigsaw-toxic-comment-classification-challenge).

## top contributors
Our goal is to create modeling pipeline collaboratively. It simply means that at the later stage of the competition we will happily invite top contributors to our team.

## bugs, questions, feature requests
I case you want to report bug or you have a question or an idea for a new feature, just submit an issue with appropriate label.
